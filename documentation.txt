Concept

This program allows the developer to save snippets of pure HTML code to be constructed
in php so that HTML code is never copy-pasted and any changes made to the files affect the whole 
website. This program also helps maintain consistent URL links throughout the website via a JSON
file. It works though inserting identifiers throughout the HTML code such as {{{ header }}} and calling
'paste' call backs to remove these identifiers with one or more html / text files or strings.

Compliments to the Scissors class

This class should be used in conjunction with apache's RewriteEngine to keep all code and html 
processing in a single file which collects $_GET variables for page navigation
